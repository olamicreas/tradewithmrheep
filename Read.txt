How to Test the WhatsApp Referral Bot

Step 1: Save the Bot’s Number & Start
	•	The user must save the bot’s number (+234 806 685 0927)
	•	Send the following message to the bot:

start


	•	The bot will respond with:
✅ A referral code (e.g., REF100)
✅ A referral link to share with others

Step 2: Share the Referral Link or Code
	•	The user shares their referral link or code with others.
	•	Example message to share:

Join this bot using my referral link: [Generated Link]  
or enter my referral code: REF100  

Step 3: The Referred User Saves Mr. Heep’s Number
	•	The referred user must:
✅ Save Mr. Heep’s phone number: +234 701 052 8330
✅ Send the following message to Mr. Heep:

Hello, Mr. Heep. I’m from REF100. My name is _____  

(Replace “REF100” with the actual referral code and “_____” with your name.)

Step 4: The Referred User Completes Verification
	•	After saving Mr. Heep’s number and sending him a message, the referred user must:
✅ Go back to the bot and send:

verify


	•	The bot will check if Mr. Heep has also saved the referred user’s contact.

Step 5: Referral is Counted
	•	Only if verification is successful, the bot will count the referral for the original user who shared the link.
	•	The referral count will increase in the leaderboard.

Step 6: Check Your Referral Count
	•	Users can check their referrals on the leaderboard page by searching for their name.

Testing Summary

✅ “start” generates a referral code and link.
✅ The referred user must save Mr. Heep’s contact and send him a message.
✅ The referred user must complete verification in the bot.
✅ The referral only counts if the verification is successful.
✅ The leaderboard updates the referral count after verification.

This ensures only real referrals are counted, as both users must save each other’s contacts
